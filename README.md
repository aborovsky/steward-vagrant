The Thing System Steward - Vagrant
=======

Vagrant virtual machine for developing The Thing System Steward.

##Installation on Windows

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

Vagrant supports [Hyper-V](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/hyperv/index.html) with Windows 8.1.

With older Windows, or if you don't want to use Hyper-V, install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and in Windows 8 disable Hyper-V (Control Panel -> Programs -> Add remove features)

As Windows has 260 character file name limitation and node modules tend to have a deep hierarchy (steward's longest file name is ~230 characters), it is recommended to put virtual machine to a folder with a path of ~20 characters.
